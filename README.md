==================

Translator for an esoteric programming language where programs are made from poems

Note: currently only limited instructions and integer registers are supported, 
and no plain English poem examples have been written yet.

To see progress so far try running: (you need python 3+)
`python translate_poem.py sample_poems/test.poem -c output.c -o output`
