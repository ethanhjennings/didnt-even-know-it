==================

Translator for an esoteric programming language where programs are made from poems

Note: no plain English poem examples have been written yet, only .poemcode examples

To see progress so far try running: (you need python 3+)
`python translate_poem.py sample_poems/guessing_game.poemcode -c output.c -o output`


This will compile and run the poem "guessing_game.poemcode" (which currently is not actually a poem, 
but just bare bones number opcodes and parameters). In this game you have to guess a number.
The program will tell you if you're too high or too low.
